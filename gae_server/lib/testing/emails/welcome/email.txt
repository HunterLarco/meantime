Sealed beta

Thanks for signing up to try Sealed, a new app for time-delayed photo and video messaging. We’re very excited to share what we’ve been working on.

As you will be one of the first people to use Sealed, we will be immensely curious to hear about your experience. We hope you’ll be willing to share your thoughts and ideas so that we can make Sealed the best it can be.

We’ll be in touch in the next few weeks with instructions for how to install the Sealed beta. Don’t worry, we take security seriously.

Thank you for your help!
